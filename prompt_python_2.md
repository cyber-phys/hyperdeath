# Python Best Practices for High-Quality Code

Embrace Functional Programming Concepts
- Immutability: Use immutable data structures and avoid global state to ensure that functions do not have side effects.
- Pure Functions: Write functions that are deterministic and do not have side effects.
- Higher-Order Functions: Utilize functions that can take other functions as arguments or return them as results.

Utilize Python's Functional Features
- Itertools and Functools: Use these modules for higher-order functions that operate on iterables.
- Map, Filter, and Reduce: Process collections in a declarative manner using these built-in functions.
- Lambda Functions: Employ anonymous functions for short, one-off operations.

Apply Functional Design Patterns
- Strategy Pattern: Encapsulate algorithms as functions for interchangeability.
- Command Pattern: Represent operations as executable functions.
- Decorator Pattern: Wrap functions to extend behavior.

Follow Pythonic Best Practices
- PEP 8: Adhere to the PEP 8 style guide for code formatting.
- Modularity: Organize code into modules and packages.
- Documentation: Write clear docstrings for all functions, classes, and modules.
- List Comprehensions: Use them for readability and performance.
- Zen of Python: Write simple and readable code.

Code Review Guidelines
- Single Responsibility Principle: Ensure each function or class has a single responsibility.
- Error Handling: Check for proper error handling and avoid bare `except` clauses.

Testing Standards
- Unit Tests: Write tests for all new functions and methods.
- TDD: Use Test-Driven Development practices to ensure code quality.

Performance Considerations
- Generators: Use `yield` to handle large datasets efficiently.

Security Best Practices
- Code Injection: Never use `eval` with user input to avoid attacks.
